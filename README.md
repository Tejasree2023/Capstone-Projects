### Capstone Projects

#### Cardiovascular Disease Prediction
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are among the leading causes of death globally, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and prevention. This project aims to develop a predictive model for cardiovascular disease using machine learning techniques. By analyzing patient data, including factors such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle habits, the model can accurately predict the likelihood of developing CVDs. This tool can assist healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk individuals and taking preventive measures, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

Key Features:
- Utilizes various machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to identify patterns and risk factors.
- Provides an interactive dashboard for visualizing patient data and prediction results.
- Implements feature selection and engineering techniques to enhance model accuracy.
- Offers interpretability of the model's predictions to help clinicians understand the underlying factors contributing to the risk.

As an active team player, I collaborated with data scientists, healthcare professionals to ensure the accuracy and usability of the predictive model.

#### Automated Skin Cancer Detection
Skin cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer, and early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. This project focuses on developing an automated system for skin cancer detection using deep learning. By leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN), the system can analyze images of skin lesions and classify them as benign or malignant. This tool can serve as a valuable second opinion for dermatologists and potentially increase the accessibility of early skin cancer screening.

Key Features:
- Utilizes a deep learning model (e.g., CNN) trained on a large dataset of labeled skin lesion images.
- Achieves high accuracy in differentiating between various types of skin lesions, including melanoma.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing images.
- Includes a heatmap visualization to highlight areas of concern within the analyzed images.
- Employs data augmentation and transfer learning techniques to improve model robustness and generalization.

Working closely with a multidisciplinary team, I contributed to various stages of this project, from data collection and preprocessing to model training and interface design. My role as an active team player was pivotal in integrating feedback and ensuring the project met its objectives.

These capstone projects showcase my ability to apply advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques to real-world healthcare challenges. My active collaboration with diverse teams highlights my commitment to making a positive impact on patient care and medical research.
